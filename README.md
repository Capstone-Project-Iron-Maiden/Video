This is the presentation of the Capstone Project for the Post Graduation in IT Solutions at Humber College.

The scope of the project was to build 6 mobile applications and one web portal to update the information presented on the mobile apps.

Our team had the privilege to work with the president of Toronto Jobs, Marc Belaiche.

In 4 months, we developed all mobile applications, a web portal, and all backend structure from scratch.

One of the requirements was to have the mobile apps available on the Apple Store and Google Play. This is why React Native was used to develop the mobile apps. The backend integration used Node.js and Firebase. And the web portal JavaScript,  HTML 5, and CSS 3 to be responsive.

Opening the portal you can see the applications available. You select one … and the data that can be update is loaded and organized by section. 

As an example … I will change the subtitle of the application at home screen … … the data will be saved on the database and  … when the user open the app again the new data will be loaded.

This strategy allows that … If there is no internet connection … the application will still work with the data pre-loaded.

… this building time will not happen with the app downloaded from any of the stores …

… as you can see …  the app loaded the new data …
